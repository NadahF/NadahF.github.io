# HangUp
WebApp for CSE 170

The main goal of our project is to develop a web application that cultivates meaningful relationships by encouraging individuals (friends, family members, and roommates) to meet up and hang out.

The homepage displays a map with pins of you and your individuals from different groups nearby.
